<I><U>Rabindranath Tagore</U></I>:- ( 
Bengali pronunciation:

), also written Rabīndranātha Thākura (7 May
1861
– 
7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev,was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music inthe late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author ofGitanjaliand its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautifulverse",

he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetrywas viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknownoutside Bengal.Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengaliliterature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential inintroducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstandingcreative artist of the modern Indian subcontinent, being highly commemorated in India and Bangladesh, as wellas in Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan. A Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral  gentryroots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At age sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym
Bhānusiṃha
("Sun Lion"), whichwere seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. He graduated to his first short stories and dramas
— 
and the aegis of his birth name
— 
by 1877. As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and strident nationalist hedenounced the Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, headvanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.
